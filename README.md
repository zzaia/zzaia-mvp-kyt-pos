# KYT (Know Your Transaction) - Anti-Money Laundering MVP

## üéì **Academic Project Information**
This repository contains one of three major postgraduate MVP projects developed for the **Data Science, Machine Learning and Data Engineering** program at **PUC-Rio University**. The project demonstrates practical application of advanced analytics techniques to solve real-world financial compliance challenges.

## üéØ **Domain & Problem Statement**

### **Domain: Financial Crime Prevention & Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**
The financial services industry faces increasing regulatory pressure to implement robust **Know Your Transaction (KYT)** systems that can identify potentially illicit financial activities in real-time. Traditional rule-based systems generate high false positive rates, requiring manual investigation that is both costly and inefficient.

### **Problem Definition**
This project addresses the challenge of **automated suspicious transaction detection** using machine learning techniques to:

- **Reduce False Positives**: Minimize unnecessary alerts that burden compliance teams
- **Improve Detection Accuracy**: Identify genuine money laundering patterns with higher precision
- **Enable Real-time Processing**: Provide scalable solutions for high-volume transaction monitoring
- **Enhance Regulatory Compliance**: Meet evolving AML/KYT regulatory requirements

### **Business Impact**
- **Cost Reduction**: Decrease manual review overhead by 60-80%
- **Risk Mitigation**: Improve detection of sophisticated laundering schemes
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Ensure compliance with FATF and local financial regulations
- **Operational Efficiency**: Enable automated decision-making for transaction monitoring

## üìä **Dataset & Methodology**

The project utilizes the **Elliptic Bitcoin Dataset**, a comprehensive collection of:
- **200,000+ Bitcoin transactions** with labeled illicit/licit classifications
- **166 feature dimensions** including local and aggregate network features
- **Real-world complexity** with temporal dependencies and graph-based relationships
