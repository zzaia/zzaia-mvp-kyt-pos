    "# MVP Know Your Transaction (KYT) - Real-Time Transaction Risk Scoring Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a comprehensive implementation of a Real-Time Transaction Risk Scoring Engine for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance in cryptocurrency transactions. The project addresses the critical need for sub-second risk assessment of Bitcoin transactions by combining traditional AML indicators with blockchain-specific risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Domain Context: Financial AML for Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Domain Definition\n",
    "Anti-Money Laundering (AML) for transactions encompasses the comprehensive framework of laws, regulations, procedures, and technological solutions designed to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income through the global financial system. This domain includes detection, prevention, and reporting of money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, market manipulation, and misuse of public funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Market Context (2025)\n",
    "- **Global Economic Impact**: Money laundering costs $800 billion to $2 trillion annually\n",
    "- **Compliance Market**: RegTech market projected to exceed $22 billion by mid-2025\n",
    "- **AI Adoption**: 56% of financial institutions use AI/ML for AML, projected to reach 90% by 2025\n",
    "- **Technology Evolution**: Sub-second transaction analysis becoming standard with 45% reduction in false positives through machine learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Domain Components\n",
    "- **Regulatory Framework**: FATF recommendations, Five Pillars of AML Compliance\n",
    "- **Transaction Monitoring**: AI-powered behavioral risk scoring, real-time processing\n",
    "- **Advanced Analytics**: Graph analytics for network detection, entity-centric analysis\n",
    "- **Data Integration**: Internal transaction records combined with external OSINT sources\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Definition: Real-Time Transaction Risk Scoring Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Develop a system that assigns risk scores (0-100) to cryptocurrency transactions in real-time, integrating traditional AML indicators with blockchain-specific risk factors including wallet clustering, transaction graph analysis, and counterparty reputation scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Requirements\n",
    "- **Problem Type**: Classification with Regression scoring (dual-objective system)\n",
    "- **Processing Speed**: Sub-second analysis for high-frequency transactions\n",
    "- **Difficulty Level**: High - requires complex multi-dimensional data processing\n",
    "- **Output Format**: Risk scores from 0-100 with binary classification (illicit/licit)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Landscape\n",
    "The system processes multiple data dimensions:\n",
    "- Transaction metadata (amounts, timestamps, fees)\n",
    "- Wallet addresses and clustering information\n",
    "- Transaction graph relationships and network topology\n",
    "- Counterparty databases and reputation scores\n",
    "- Sanctions lists and regulatory databases\n",
    "- Temporal patterns and behavioral baselines\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended Architecture: Sequential Pipeline\n",
    "Based on real-time processing requirements, the system implements a two-stage approach:\n",
    "1. **Stage 1**: Fast binary classification for suspicious/non-suspicious determination\n",
    "2. **Stage 2**: Detailed risk scoring (0-100) for transactions flagged as suspicious\n",
    "\n",
    "This architecture optimizes performance by only applying expensive regression analysis to transactions that pass the initial screening threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset: Elliptic Data Set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview\n",
    "- **Source**: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set)\n",
    "- **Scale**: 200,000 Bitcoin transactions with 166 feature dimensions\n",
    "- **Size**: Approximately 6GB of professionally curated data\n",
    "- **Quality**: Industry-standard dataset used extensively in academic research\n",
    "- **Suitability Score**: 92/100 for this specific use case\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Categories\n",
    "- **Local Features (94)**: Transaction-specific attributes including fees, input/output volumes, BTC amounts\n",
    "- **Aggregate Features (72)**: Neighborhood and graph-based metrics derived from transaction relationships\n",
    "- **Temporal Component**: Time step information for temporal pattern analysis\n",
    "- **Graph Topology**: Wallet clustering information and network connectivity metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Label Distribution\n",
    "- **Illicit Transactions**: ~2% (professionally verified criminal activity)\n",
    "- **Licit Transactions**: ~21% (verified legitimate transactions)\n",
    "- **Unknown Transactions**: ~77% (unlabeled data suitable for semi-supervised learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Dataset is Optimal\n",
    "1. **Professional Curation**: Created by Elliptic Co., a leading blockchain analytics company\n",
    "2. **Rich Feature Set**: 166 dimensions provide comprehensive basis for both classification and risk scoring\n",
    "3. **Graph Integration**: Essential blockchain-specific features for transaction network analysis\n",
    "4. **Real-time Applicability**: Preprocessed features enable sub-second inference\n",
    "5. **Academic Validation**: Extensively tested and validated in research literature\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequential Pipeline Implementation\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def score_transaction(transaction_features):\n",
    "    # Stage 1: Fast binary classification\n",
    "    is_suspicious = binary_classifier.predict_proba(transaction_features)[1]\n",
    "    \n",
    "    if is_suspicious > threshold:\n",
    "        # Stage 2: Detailed risk scoring\n",
    "        risk_score = regression_model.predict(transaction_features)[0]\n",
    "        return min(max(risk_score, 0), 100)  # Clamp to 0-100\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return is_suspicious * 30  # Low base score for non-suspicious\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative Approaches Considered\n",
    "- **Multi-task Learning**: Single neural network with dual outputs\n",
    "- **Parallel Ensemble**: Simultaneous classification and regression branches\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Risk Scoring**: Tiered classification with tier-specific regression models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering for Risk Scoring\n",
    "Risk scores will be derived from weighted combinations of:\n",
    "- Transaction amount percentiles (30% weight)\n",
    "- Neighbor risk aggregates (40% weight)\n",
    "- Temporal anomaly scores (30% weight)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Targets\n",
    "- **Processing Latency**: Sub-second transaction analysis\n",
    "- **False Positive Rate**: < 10% for mature system implementation\n",
    "- **Detection Accuracy**: > 95% for known money laundering typologies\n",
    "- **Risk Score Precision**: Continuous 0-100 scoring with interpretable thresholds\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Value\n",
    "- **Compliance Enhancement**: Automated SAR generation and regulatory reporting\n",
    "- **Operational Efficiency**: 50%+ reduction in manual investigation time\n",
    "- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive threat prevention vs. reactive response\n",
    "- **Customer Experience**: Minimal friction for legitimate transactions\n",
