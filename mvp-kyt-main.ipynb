    "## MVP Know Your Transaction (KYT) - Real-Time Transaction Risk Scoring Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a comprehensive implementation of a Real-Time Transaction Risk Scoring Engine for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance in cryptocurrency transactions. The project addresses the critical need for sub-second risk assessment of Bitcoin transactions by combining traditional AML indicators with blockchain-specific risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Context: Financial AML for Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Domain Definition\n",
    "Anti-Money Laundering (AML) for transactions encompasses the comprehensive framework of laws, regulations, procedures, and technological solutions designed to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income through the global financial system. This domain includes detection, prevention, and reporting of money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, market manipulation, and misuse of public funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition: Real-Time Transaction Risk Classification Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "Develop a system that assigns risk classifications to cryptocurrency transactions in real-time, integrating traditional AML indicators with blockchain-specific risk factors including wallet clustering, transaction graph analysis, and counterparty reputation scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical Requirements\n",
    "- **Problem Type**: Classification \n",
    "- **Processing Speed**: Sub-second analysis for high-frequency transactions\n",
    "- **Difficulty Level**: High - requires complex multi-dimensional data processing\n",
    "- **Output Format**: Risk binary classification (illicit/licit)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Landscape\n",
    "The system processes multiple data dimensions:\n",
    "- Transaction metadata (amounts, timestamps, fees)\n",
    "- Wallet addresses and clustering information\n",
    "- Transaction graph relationships and network topology\n",
    "- Counterparty databases and reputation scores\n",
    "- Sanctions lists and regulatory databases\n",
    "- Temporal patterns and behavioral baselines\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implementation is based on the comprehensive research and analysis conducted during the project development phase. The following reference documents were used in the composition of this initial description:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Domain Research**: [current-domain.md](domains/current-domain.md) - Contains detailed market analysis, regulatory framework research, and commercial viability assessment for the Financial AML domain\n",
    "- **Problem Analysis**: [current-problem.md](problems/current-problem.md) - Provides comprehensive problem refinement, technical requirements analysis, and solution approach evaluation\n",
    "- **Dataset Evaluation**: [current-dataset.md](datasets/current-dataset.md) - Documents dataset selection criteria, suitability scoring, and detailed feature analysis for the Elliptic dataset\n",
    "- **Dataset Analysis & Preprocessing**: [dataset-analysis-and-preprocessing.ipynb](datasets/scripts/dataset-analysis-and-preprocessing.ipynb) - Comprehensive Jupyter notebook containing Elliptic dataset download, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, preprocessing pipeline, and ML preparation steps\n",
    "\n",
    "These reference documents contain the foundational research that informed the technical approach, feature engineering strategy, and implementation decisions reflected in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as the primary entry point for the MVP KYT implementation, providing both technical implementation and business context for real-time cryptocurrency transaction risk assessment."
