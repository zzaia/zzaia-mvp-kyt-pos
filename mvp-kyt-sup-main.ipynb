    "## MVP Know Your Transaction (KYT) - Transaction Risk Classification Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook presents a comprehensive implementation of a Transaction Risk Classification Engine for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance in cryptocurrency transactions. The project addresses the critical need for risk assessment of Bitcoin transactions by combining traditional AML indicators with blockchain-specific risk factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Domain Context: Financial AML for Transactions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Core Domain Definition\n",
    "Anti-Money Laundering (AML) for transactions encompasses the comprehensive framework of laws, regulations, procedures, and technological solutions designed to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained funds as legitimate income through the global financial system. This domain includes detection, prevention, and reporting of money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion, market manipulation, and misuse of public funds.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Definition: Transaction Risk Classification Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "Develop a system that assigns risk classifications to cryptocurrency transactions in real-time, integrating traditional AML indicators with blockchain-specific risk factors including wallet clustering, transaction graph analysis, and counterparty reputation scoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technical Requirements\n",
    "- **Problem Type**: Classification \n",
    "- **Processing Speed**: Sub-second analysis for high-frequency transactions\n",
    "- **Difficulty Level**: High - requires complex multi-dimensional data processing\n",
    "- **Output Format**: Risk binary classification (illicit = 1 /licit = 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Landscape\n",
    "The system can processes multiple data dimensions:\n",
    "- Transaction metadata (amounts, timestamps, fees)\n",
    "- Wallet addresses and clustering information\n",
    "- Transaction graph relationships and network topology\n",
    "- Counterparty databases and reputation scores\n",
    "- Sanctions lists and regulatory databases\n",
    "- Temporal patterns and behavioral baselines\n",
    "\n",
    "### References\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implementation is based on the comprehensive research and analysis conducted during the project development phase. The following reference documents were used in the composition of this initial description:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Domain Research**: [current-domain.md](domains/current-domain.md) - Contains detailed market analysis, regulatory framework research, and commercial viability assessment for the Financial AML domain;\n",
    "- **Problem Analysis**: [current-problem.md](problems/current-problem.md) - Provides comprehensive problem refinement, technical requirements analysis, and solution approach evaluation;\n",
    "- **Dataset Evaluation**: [current-dataset.md](datasets/current-dataset.md) - Documents dataset selection criteria, suitability scoring, and detailed feature analysis for the Elliptic dataset;\n",
    "- **Dataset Analysis & Preprocessing**: [dataset-analysis-and-preprocessing.ipynb](datasets/scripts/dataset-analysis-and-preprocessing.ipynb) - Comprehensive Jupyter notebook containing Elliptic dataset download, exploratory data analysis, and ML preparation steps;\n",
    "\n",
    "These reference documents contain the foundational research that informed the technical approach, feature engineering strategy, and implementation decisions reflected in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as the primary entry point for the MVP KYT implementation and it can run independently, providing both technical implementation and business context for real cryptocurrency transaction risk assessment."

    "### Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Some considerations must be made before the conclusion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compressed data can increase training time but reduces dataset sizes without influencing the final result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Models like Naive Bayes reached almost 0.6 in contrast to other models and were removed from training;  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Models like Logistic Regression also had poor performance and were removed from training, but they are used in some ensembles as default estimator models. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Future improvements to training:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The unsupervised approach could produce good or even better results because it would use much more data to identify patterns by using the complete dataset. Also, the labeled dataset could indicate which clusters could be labeled with the illicit class;\n",
    "\n",
    "- The training could use models more recommended for graph-type datasets, such as Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), making use of the edge dataset to learn patterns with deeper transaction chains, not only direct neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Production readiness:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- This training was performed on a dataset curated for research purposes. There is no information about which features were used, so in order to have a production-ready model, a new dataset in the same format would need to be gathered and curated;\n",
    "\n",
    "- A final performance indicator would need to be established to consider the model ready for a production environment, by classifying real labeled current data."

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model Performance Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "This supervised learning approach successfully developed a high-performance KYT system achieving **88.49% performance** on cryptocurrency transaction risk classification. The **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** emerged as the champion model, demonstrating superior performance in distinguishing illicit from licit Bitcoin transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Technical Achievements\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA preprocessing reduced feature space from 166 to 59 dimensions while preserving 95% variance\n",
    "- **Algorithm Comparison**: Comprehensive evaluation of 10 ML algorithms with hyperparameter optimization via RandomizedSearchCV  \n",
    "- **Model Ranking**: SVM (88.49%) > KNN (86.87%) > GB (85.02%) demonstrated that ensemble and kernel methods excel in financial pattern recognition\n",
    "- **Pipeline Standardization**: StandardScaler + PCA + model architecture ensures consistent preprocessing across algorithms\n",
    "- **Model Persistence**: All trained models saved with compression for deployment scalability\n",
    "- **Performance Validation**: Stratified cross-validation ensures reliable performance on imbalanced financial data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Real-World Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "The trained model successfully processed **157,205 unlabeled transactions**, identifying **12,675 potentially illicit transactions**, providing risk assessment capabilities for unknown data—essential for AML compliance."
